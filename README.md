## My Reflection
From this industry talk, I will become a system developer in the next 4 years. In order to achieve my dream, I need to continue learning, especially problem solving and communication. I also have to learn more about the world of technology from systems to hardware. Not forgetting that I have to follow the current of modernization in the world of technology so as not to be left behind. Therefore, I must remain proactive and have an organized future strategy.
